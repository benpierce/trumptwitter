**Data Source**: Donald Trump's Twitter feed (http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive)

This project is first and foremost a text generation learning project using deep neural networks. The goal of the project is to ingest a significant number of tweets (in this case Donald Trump's twitter feed) and to be able to produce new tweets in a similar format and on similar themes.

Why is something like this significant? Imagine being able to feed a neural net a cross section of tweets based on timeseries, geographic location or another demographically significant attribute. With a good enough neural network, topics could be provided to the neural net and opinions or sentiments could be mined and studied without having to interact with real individuals (typically the most cost-intensive part of a research study).
